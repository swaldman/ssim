    <h2><a name="basics">Basics</a></h2>
    <p>
      Server-Side Image Manager is a library designed to simplify the management of images
      on websites. In particular, webites often require that the same basic image be made
      available in multiple sizes. Common examples include icons or logos, which may be 
      dispersed throught a website in many sizes, or photographs which are presented in
      thumbnail form, and then are made available at multiple resolutions.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are many approaches to dealing with the problem of multiple scaled images,
      but none of them are optimal. Lazy webmasters just supply a large image 
      and use HTML width and height attributes to force clients to scale the images, 
      but this is a very inefficient solution: to display even an icon or thumbnail, 
      the client has to download the oversized image and rescale it, wasting bandwith 
      and client CPU. More diligent webmasters prescale the image by hand to each desired 
      size. But, this approach is a pain in the ass, a maintenance problem -- every time 
      an image changes, or a new size is desired, the webmaster must remember to reproduce 
      all required scaled instances.
    </p>
    <p>
      Server-Side Image Manager allows webmasters to get the performance and efficiency
      advantages of prescaling without the maintenance problems. SSIM transforms images
      into dynamic rather than static resources. For example, an HTML page might
      reference an image tags that look like any of the following:
      <dl class="url_examples">
	  <dt>&lt;img src="cool_pic.jpg?width=50"&gt;</dt>
	  <dd>
	    <i>
	      references cool_pic.jpg, scaled to a width of 50 pixes and its natural, 
	      aspect-ratio-preserving height.
	    </i>
	  </dd>
	  <dt>&lt;img src="cool_pic.jpg?height=50"&gt;</dt>
	  <dd>
	    <i>
	      references cool_pic.jpg, scaled to a height of 50 pixes and its natural, 
	      aspect-ratio-preserving width.
	    </i>
	  </dd>
	  <dt>&lt;img src="cool_pic.jpg?width=200&height=300"&gt;</dt>
	  <dd>
	    <i>
	      references cool_pic.jpg, scaled to a width of 200 pixels and a height of 
	      300 pixels, even if this results in the image being distorted.
	    </i>
	  </dd>
	  <dt>&lt;img src="cool_pic.jpg?width=200&height=300&preserveAspectRatio=true"&gt;</dt>
	  <dd>
	    <i>
	      references cool_pic.jpg, scaled to the maximum size possible that
	      will fit within a bounding box of width 200 and height 300, but 
	      that preserves the image's natural aspect ratio.
	    </i>
	  </dd>
	  <dt>&lt;img src="imageservlet?imageUrl=http://foo.booboo.com/faraway_pic.jpg?width=200"&gt;</dt>
	  <dd>
	    <i>
	      references faraway_pic.jpg on some other server, scaled to a width of 200 pixels
	    </i>
	  </dd>
      </dl>
    </p>
    <p>
      Server-side Image Manager caches the images it generates and serves, so, after
      the first request for a scaled version, users see performance similar to static
      images. Great care has been taken in the development of the library to ensure
      maximum concurrent access to images, while making sure that clients never see
      incomplete or broken images while images are being scaled and cached.
    </p>
    <p>
      Server-side Image Manage can be used as a Servlet in java-based web applications, 
      or, in combination with a standalone servlet environment, as a service that non-Java
      based websites can use to manage their images.
    </p>
    <h2><a name="prerequisites">Prerequisites</a></h2>
    <p>
      SSIM requires a that a Java Virtual Machine, version 1.4 or higher, and 
      a Java Servlet environment, version 2.3 or higher, be the server that will
      manage your images. Users who wish to run SSIM in combination with a non-Java 
      webserver can do so by setting up the free Tomcat server as a standalone service.
      If you wish to use SSIM as a service for an external, non-Java web-application,
      it will be helpful to install Apache Ant, which will "automagically" do the Java-specific 
      stuff required to use SSIM.
    </p>
    <h2><a name="ssim_as_servlet">Using SSIM as a Servlet in a Java Web Application</a></h2>
    <p>
      If you plan to use Server-Side Image Manager as a servlet, you should already be
      familiar with the how to deploy Java Servlets and web applications. Nothing
      more will be required of you than adding SSIM's jar file to your web-application,
      and configuring the servlet in your <tt>web.xml</tt> file. See the 
      <a href="#appendix_c_sample_web_xml">sample <tt>web.xml</tt> in Appendix C</a> below.
    </p>
    <p>
      The classname of the SSIM's servlet is <tt>com.mchange.v2.ssim.SsimServlet</tt>.
      You'll need to be sure that all requests to images that should be handled by
      the servlet get mapped to the servlet, usually by providing suffix url-mappings
      such as *.gif, *.jpg, etc. See the <a href="#appendix_c_sample_web_xml">sample</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The servlet accepts a bunch of initialization parameters, which are described
      in detail in <a href="#appendix_a_initialization_parameters">Appendix A</a>. While
      all initialization parameters are optional, you'll probably want to set at least
      <a href="#init_param_cacheDir">cacheDir</a>, since it defaults to using the web applications
      temporary directory, which may not be preserved between web application restarts.
    </p>
    <h2><a name="ssim_non-Java_website">Using SSIM to manage images for a non-Java website</a></h2>
    <p>
      You can plug SSIM into apache or other webservers and let it manage your images for you. You'll have to
      figure out how to run Java servlets and web applications in combination with your webserver. One common 
      configuration is to use the <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/">Apache webserver</a>, 
      <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat/">Apache Jakarta Tomcat</a>, 
      and <a href="http://apache.130th.net/jakarta/tomcat-connectors/">mod_jk or mod_jk2</a>. You'll also
      need to install Apache Ant.
    </p>
    <p>
      The SSIM distribution contains a directory called <tt>build-service</tt>. Enter this
      directory, edit the file <tt>build.properties</tt> to set up your 
      <a href="#appendix_a_initialization_parameters">initialization parameters</a>, and then type <tt>ant</tt>.
      This will build your service web application, which you will find as a war file (ending in <tt>.war</tt>)
      underneath the directory called <tt>dist</tt> that will appear after you've run <tt>ant</tt>. Configure
      your webserver to deploy this Java web application, and that's it! (All of this will be easy if you're used
      to deploying Java web-apps in your environment. It might be a pain and a lot of configuring if you're not...)
    </p>
    <p>
      The crucial thing is to get the initialization parameters right in <tt>build.properties</tt>. Let's say you
      have an existing website, whose document root is <tt>/usr/local/web</tt>, and you want to make its images
      scalable. You'd edit <tt>build.properties</tt> to look something like this:
      <div class="example_properties">

	#
	# The name of the war file that should be generated
	# WITHOUT THE .war SUFFIX (e.g. use "images" to generate
	# "images.war")
	#
	# REQUIRED
	#
	web.app.name=scaledimages
	
	#
	# Servlet Initialization Parameters
	# all are optional, but cacheDir and cacheSize are strongly recommended
	# (Please see Server-Side Image Manager documentation!)
	#
	# Uncomment and supply the ones you want
	#
	
	<strong>baseUrl.init.param=file:///usr/local/web/</strong>
	cacheDir.init.param=/var/tmp
	#cacheSize.init.param=
	#cullDelay.init.param=
	#maxWidth.init.param=
	#maxHeight.init.param=
	#allowDomains.init.param=
      </div>
      You'd run <tt>ant</tt>, then deploy the <tt>images.war</tt> file you'd find under <tt>build-service/dist</tt>,
      under the alias (or in Java-speak <tt>contextPath</tt>) <tt>/scaledimages</tt>. You'd go through your web application
      and for any images you'd like scaled, change the image tags like 
      <strong><tt>&lt;img src="/icons/logo.gif" width="200"&gt;</tt></strong> to 
      <strong><tt>&lt;img src="/scaledimages/icons/logo.gif?width=200"&gt;</tt></strong>.(You'd need to be careful of image source urls
      specified relative to the HTML page, and change them to absolute URLs based on the webserver's document root (URLs
      beginning with "/") if you want SSIM to scale these images.
    </p>
    <h2><a name="ssim_as_a_service">SSIM as a Stand-Alone Service</a></h2>
    <p>
      You can use SSIM as a "standalone" image server, put your images in its care,
      and let your non-Java website refer to the images via absolute URLs. Just download
      Jakarta Tomcat, configure a web-application as described above, add the war file
      to Tomcat's web-app directory and Voila! you have a dedicated, scaling HTTP server
      for your images.
    </p>
    <h2><a name="ssim_as_a_hybrid">Using SSIM to manage both web-app images and certain external images</a></h2>
    <p>
      <b>[Advanced]</b> It is frequently useful to have images both internal to a Java web application and 
      external to the application's war file be managed by SSIM. For example, if you want
      to write a photoalbum application, you might wish to let the images be stored in
      some easily modifiable external directory, but also have images internal to the
      web-application itself. You can do this by defining a web-application-scoped variable
      (i.e. a ServletContext attribute) under the name <tt>com_mchange_v2_ssim_SsimServlet__patternReplacementMap</tt>,
      which must be of type <tt>com.mchange.v2.util.PatternReplacementMap</tt> (see 
      <a href="api/com/mchange/v2/util/PatternReplacementMap.html">javadocs</a>). If you
      do this, SsimServlet will check each requests path (URI) against a list of regular expression. If
      the path matches, SSIM substitute the replacement path you specify for the original. The replacement
      paths may depend upon the originally requested path, by virtue of the common regular expression
      convention that allows regexes to contain parenthesized subgroupings, and regex replacement expressions to refer
      to those groupings as $1 for the first subgrouping, $2 for the second, and $0 for the whole matching
      expression. The replacements should be absolute URLs. They may be <tt>file:</tt> URLs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Any path that resolves to a URL via the PatternReplacementMap will be retrieved from this URL. These
      paths are considered trusted -- no further security checks will be performed -- and they take 
      precedence over any <tt>baseResourcePath</tt> or <tt>baseUrl</tt> you may have set.
    </p>
    <h2><a name="appendix_a_initialization_parameters">Appendix A: Initialization Parameters</a></h2>

	a url like <tt>myImage.png?mimeType=image/jpeg</tt> (or in URL-encoded form <tt>myImage.png?mimeType=image%2fjpeg</tt>)
