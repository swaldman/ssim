/**
 * <p>Fully reentrant. We could still separate the shared and exclusive wait() sets for greater efficiency
 * under circumstances of high contention, but it would require extra synchronizations even under low
 * contention, so we'll leave this as is, and maybe write a different class that presumes large wait
 * sets.</p>
 *
 * <p>Because this class is reentrant, lock relinquishes can't be idempotent -- we have to keep track of
 * precisely how many times the lock was acquired and then release. Clients therefore have to be very
 * careful that every acquisition is matched by exactly one relinquish. The way to do this is to acquire
 * locks immediately <i>before</i> a try lock, and putting the relinquish in the finally block. One
 * should not attempt to acquire the locks within the try block, because if the lock acquisition is
 * interrupted, the lock relinquish in the finally block will run without the lock acquisition having
 * succeeded.</p>
