0.6.0
  -- added a maxConcurrency init-param to SsimServlet to avoid OutOfMemoryErrors
     when a client makes a request for many scaled images simultaneously (as often happens
     on the first load of a "contact sheet"-style photo album).
  -- added cacheUnmodified(...) check to "short path", so that we cache even unscaled images
     that are not local to the webapp.
  -- defined a web-app scope key that SsimServlet checks, where other entities in a web-app
     can set up a PatternReplaceMap to override the default URI that the servlet will use
     to find the original image. (This is useful for web-apps that will want SSIMServlet to
     manage both images internal and external to the web-app).
0.5.0
  -- creates pseudosuffixes for webapps that want to control which graphics are scalable (sjpg, jpeg, sgif, spng, stiff, stif)
  -- let ImageData include when possible file size information, for proper content-length setting
  -- define better encoding for filename (so that two files, where one is analogously defined in a subdirectory 
     that the other has in its name delimited by '.' don't conflict)
  -- allow the size of the cache directory to be limited, and provide user defined maximum sizes, to prevent the size of 
     the cache directory from growing arbitrarily large and to discourage denial-of-service attacks
